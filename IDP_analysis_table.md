# Intrinsically Disordered Protein (IDP) Analysis of Top 200 PDB Proteins

## Analysis Overview

This table analyzes the top 200 proteins with the most entries in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as of January 20, 2021, classifying each as either an **Intrinsically Disordered Protein (IDP)** or a **Structured Protein**. The table is sorted by the original rank from the PDB data (rank 1 = highest number of PDB entries, rank 200 = lowest).

**Criteria for IDP Classification:**

- Proteins that lack stable secondary/tertiary structure under physiological conditions
- Proteins with significant disordered regions (>30% of sequence)
- Proteins known to exist in multiple conformational states
- Proteins that undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding

## Summary Statistics

**Total Proteins Analyzed:** 200

**Classification Breakdown:**

- **Structured Proteins:** 167 (83.5%)
- **Partially Disordered Proteins:** 25 (12.5%)
- **Highly Disordered Proteins:** 8 (4.0%)

**Notable IDPs and Partially Disordered Proteins:**

1. **Cellular tumor antigen p53** (Rank 21) - Highly disordered tumor suppressor
2. **Microtubule-associated protein tau** (Rank 122) - Highly disordered cytoskeletal protein
3. **cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor alpha** (Rank 54) - Highly disordered inhibitor
4. **Histones H2A, H2B, H3.1, H3.3, H4** - Partially disordered with structured cores and disordered tails
5. **Nuclear receptor coactivators 1 & 2** - Partially disordered transcription cofactors
6. **Androgen receptor** - Partially disordered with structured domains

**Key Observations:**

- Most proteins in the top PDB entries are well-structured, which reflects the bias toward crystallizable proteins
- Intrinsically disordered proteins are underrepresented in PDB due to technical challenges in structural determination
- Many chromatin proteins (histones) show partial disorder, particularly in their N- and C-terminal tails
- Transcription factors and cofactors often contain significant disordered regions
- The prevalence of structured proteins (83.5%) reflects PDB's historical focus on well-folded, crystallizable proteins

**Methodological Notes:**

- Classification based on current literature and known structural properties
- "Partially Disordered" indicates proteins with both structured domains and significant disordered regions (>20% disordered)
- "Highly Disordered" indicates proteins with >50% disordered content or functional dependence on disorder
- Many proteins may have conditional disorder that is not captured in crystal structures
- Table is sorted by original PDB rank (1-200) from the source data
